# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project was created as part of the **Data Science Bootcamp** organized by **Google Developer Groups (GDG)**. The goal was to explore a real-world dataset, apply data science techniques, and extract meaningful insights to solve a business problem — in this case, **predicting and analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, impacting revenue and long-term growth. This project investigates key factors behind churn using Python-based data analysis and visualization.

We analyzed customer demographics, service usage, contract types, billing methods, and tenure to understand their relationship with churn.

## 📌 Key Findings

- 📈 **Short-term contract users** have a significantly higher churn rate compared to long-term customers.
- 🧾 **Paperless billing and higher monthly charges** are strongly associated with increased churn.
- 🔐 **Value-added services** like Tech Support and Online Security reduce churn rates.
- 👵 **Senior citizens** and **new customers** (tenure < 1 year) are more likely to churn.
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Customers with dependents are more loyal.

## 🚀 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization & storytelling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
